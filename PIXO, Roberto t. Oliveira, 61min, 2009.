it's not graffiti, it's pixo

00:01:12
We get there, and there is a nuch or fich guys, assholes, and a bunch of hypocrites

00:01:32
We don't care. pixador flash it to everyone. it's pure anarchy, it's hate, y'know?

00:05:15
Alphaville, it's an apartment complex, it's a luxury thing, y'know.
Ghetto is very different from luxury stuff.

00:06:57
In Sao Paoul there many cartories of "pixo"
There are people that only pixo walls
There are people that only pixo windows
other that just do buildings
There are others that do climbing
And there are those who do it all
but the main of pixo in sao paulo, aside it's categories is to do a lot of pixo

00:07:28
CHOQUE , photographe
Sao Paulos pixo is a closed communication, it's from pixo to pixo
So ,it really doesn't communicate with the rest of society.
it's an aggression. its purpose is to attack society.

00:08:34
The city of sao paulo has become an agent of vertical letters, wich means, the writing of pixo in sao paulo is going to follow the guidelins of the city.it's alsmost as if the city of SAo Paulo was a huge notebook and the pixador ar filling those spaces, y'know ?

the pixo hold a mask. a lot of people find it ugly that it was done by some animal. but it's matter of conviviality it's about learning to realize it.

CHOQUE

So pixo, in fact migrated from the punk movement in the early 80
CHOQUE
They got inspired in the logos of rock bands to create thier own logos

00:09:58
CHOQUE
And the brand's logos were inspired by the anglo saxon runes of millions of years ago wich are indeed the first european alphabet. that was used byt the germanics, scandinavians and anglo-saxons...
and the pixador have perfected this writing and built on it, it's a anthropophagi. ther is a creative process behind a very elaborative artistic process. it's amazing how the writing of the barbarians of many centuries ago has migrated to Sao Paulo to it's barbarians: the pixadores.

Graffiti is a commercial thing, they do it to make money.

00:15:56
CHOQUE
This pixo in Sao Paulo, as we know it, it's not the pioneer.
The first one is the political pixo the one against the dictatorship, wich started in the 60s and was basically the " no more dictatorship!"
Its nature was political. there were no esthetic concerns with the writing. The point was to be readable to anyone. after the dictatorship's pixo that is the political pixo, started the poetic pixo wich self-explanatory, it's about poetic phrases.
And in the early 80s as outspread of punk movement's pixo, which was also a poitical pixo, started the SAo Paulo pixo wich focuses in the pixador's ego .
The precursor was the brazilian Mastiff Dog in Anhanguera's road, km26, that actually was not by a pixador as we know them to be nowadays.
He was the owner of Mastiff breeder, that used to sell dogs, and he tagged the whole city with that pixo. "Brazilian Mastiff Dog, km 26"

82 pixo really beguns to grow, with juneca, bilao and pessoinha,

And most of pixador are not the bourgeoisie.
They are all from the hoods.
There is only a few playboys that do pixo.

A lot of people from the ghetto, that suffer with poverty, would like to speak up ( DENONCEZ ), to express themselvers, but they can't.
The only ones who have the right to say something, the ones thant can comment onn things are those own money.

00:24:54
First is the social recognition, second comes hobby and adrenaline and the third one is the protest aspect of it.

00:25:06
NALDO
The government wants a dumb nation, people that are stupid and without education. We are pixador but none of us is stupid. Everybody reads newspaper, and knows what's going on.

TATEI
When we met, we were ready to be on media. We pixo to be on TV, Newspaper, internet, eveyrthing that is possible.

O ESTADO DE SAN PAULO
16 janvier 2008 ARTICLE

We are doing our job. We do our protest, our indignations on walls and that is that.
Where happened a murder, or at someone's that is doing anything illegal.
if his gouse doesn't have a wall, we will do it one the gouse in front of it, on his neighbor.
what really matter is that we leave a message of him.
( Article et mur en lien contre un partie d'extreme droite)
The might not get arrested, but they weill have to deal with that, all eyes are on him. The politicians will see that we know what is going wrong. This the voice of the nation right here, on the walls.
